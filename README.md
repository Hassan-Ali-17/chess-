# chess-
This repository contains a fully functional chess game implemented in C++.
This project is a console-based Chess game implemented in C++ using pointers and double pointers. It was developed as part of a semester project. The primary objective was to practice advanced C++ programming techniques, specifically focusing on memory management and the use of pointers.

Features
Full Chess Functionality: All standard chess rules are implemented.

User Interface: Simple text-based interface.

Efficient Memory Usage: Uses pointers and double pointers to manage the game board and pieces dynamically.

Game Play: Supports two players, allowing for a complete game from start to finish.
